# Developing a Personal Expense Tracker with Python and SQLite

Introduction
As part of an academic course on software development and database management, I developed a Personal Expense Tracker using Python and SQLite. This project aimed to apply practical programming skills and introduce database management principles.

Project Overview

Key Features:

Add Expenses: Users can input expenses with details such as date, category, description, and amount.
View Expenses: The program displays all recorded expenses for easy tracking.
Calculate Totals: It calculates daily, monthly, and yearly expense totals.
Exit Program: Users can safely exit the program with all data saved.

Data Management:

Initially, expenses were stored in CSV files for simplicity.
The project was later enhanced by transitioning to an SQLite database for better data management and performance.

Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in Python programming and database management, transitioning from basic CSV file storage to a more robust SQLite database solution. The experience solidified my understanding of both software development and practical database management techniques.
